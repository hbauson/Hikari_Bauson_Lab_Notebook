### Watched Jonathan PCR samples 87-94 Elutions 1 and 2
* total 16 +1 for MasterMix
PCR -> Polymerase Chain Reaction
* extracted DNA + MasterMix
1.5 mL tube for MM, 16 small tubes 

MasterMix
* BSA, GTG, Molecular grade H₂O, Fwd Primer, and Rev Primer
* Proportions in Excel
* Centrifuge
* Add MM first into all the small tubes with 1 tip
* 18µL MM, 2µL DNA = 20µL total
* Thermal cycler - EXOCB for ~2.5hrs.

### Gel Electrophorasis (small) (~45min.)
* Instructions in drawer
* Prepare gel box -> clear body, rubber stoppers, 2 well plates
