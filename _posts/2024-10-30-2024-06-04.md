### Watched Jonathan PCR samples 87-94 Elutions 1 and 2
* total 16 +1 for MasterMix
PCR -> Polymerase Chain Reaction
* extracted DNA + MasterMix
1.5 mL tube for MM, 16 small tubes 

MasterMix
* BSA, GTG, Molecular grade H₂O, Fwd Primer, and Rev Primer
* Proportions in Excel
* Centrifuge
* Add MM first into all the small tubes with 1 tip
* 18µL MM, 2µL DNA = 20µL total
* Thermal cycler - EXOCB for ~2.5hrs.

### Gel Electrophorasis (small) (~45min.)
* Instructions in drawer
* Prepare gel box -> clear body, rubber stoppers, 2 well plates
* Measure Agarose into boat -- **2g**
* Measure TAE into beaker --- **100mL**
* Set microwave to 2 minutes
* Pour Agarose into TAE + swirl before heating
* Place in microwave and press start. Wait till boiling (~1min.)
* Remove and stir vigorously by placing bottom on counter firmly and moving in circles
* If particles still floating, heat again (much faster than before!)
* Make sure solution is perfectly clear
* Obtain SmartGlow from Pre-PCR refridgerator and pipette **6µL** into the beaker with heated solution, mix again
* Pour gently into gel box
* Let cool in drawer out of light (~30min.)
* Carefully remove rubber holders and well plates, place in gel chamber with top facing the black side of the chamger and bottom facing the red
* Fill chamber with used TAE to MAX line, removing bubbles with a loose pipette tip
* Pipette **5µL** 50bp DNA ladder into first wells of each row
* Pipette **7µL** of PCR product + control into other wells
* Constant Mode on electrophorasis machine, press "Mode" (Make sure it is 100V, 1A, and 30 minutes)
* Place cover on chamber, tighten nobs corresponding to the colors (black and red)
* Start the machine

### Imaging: ChemDoc
* Turn on switches for black box and back of imager
* Remove gel from chamber and gel box, draining the used TAE into the gel chamber
* Place on frame
* Turn on laptop and click Protocol 1
* Follow the instructions to image
* Save image in desired folder
